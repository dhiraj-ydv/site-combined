title: How India's CBDC Will Fit into Digital Payments
---

The RBI has launched the Indian CBDC, known as the E-Rupee. This should not be confused with e-RUPI, which refers to prepaid vouchers from the Government of India.

Let's first talk a little bit about UPI:

UPI, developed by NPCI, is a proven technology in the digital payments space.

However, several risks are associated with UPI because the UPI ID is directly linked to the bank account. This means that if your UPI ID is compromised, a scammer could empty your bank balance.

NPCI has already taken several steps to address this problem. For example, with new updates to UPI, you can only send up to INR 2,000 within the first four hours in case of a new recipient.

But this limits digital payments. What if someone is traveling and needs to fill their car's fuel tank? Suppose they purchase fuel for INR 5,000, and it's the first time they visit that fuel station. This means they can't use UPI to make a digital payment in this case.

The government surely does not want this; they aim to promote digital payments.

You may ask why the government wants to promote digital payments.

A significant portion of central government funds is wasted on printing, transporting, and storing paper currency. Paper currency also contributes to black money and corruption, as it can be nearly impossible to track paper-currency transactions.

The costs associated with the infrastructure required for digital payments (i.e., server management) are much lower compared to the costs and drawbacks associated with paper money.

Some people suggest that the government might start charging for UPI payments in the future, but I think this is unlikely. Digital payments save a lot of trouble for the government. Digital transactions can be easily tracked by the government if needed.

So, coming back to the point, what if someone needs to make a digital transaction of more than INR 2,000 to a new recipient and can't wait for four hours? This is where the E-Rupee comes in.

The E-Rupee is essentially a digital wallet that you can top up using UPI and use for payments.

Since this wallet is not directly linked to your bank account, it is relatively safe.

NPCI says that UPI is primarily intended for person-to-person transactions. So if you need to pay a merchant (for both small and large payments), you can use the E-Rupee.
